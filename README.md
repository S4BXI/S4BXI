# S4BXI

[![ci](https://framagit.org/s4bxi/s4bxi/badges/master/pipeline.svg)](https://framagit.org/s4bxi/s4bxi/pipelines?scope=branches)

S4BXI is a simulator of the [Portals4 network API](https://cs.sandia.gov/Portals/). It is written using SimGrid's S4U interface, which provides a fast flow-model. More specifically, this simulator is tuned to model as best as possible Bull's hardware implementation of portals ([BXI interconnect](https://atos.net/produits/calcul-haute-performance-hpc/bxi-bull-exascale-interconnect))

The documentation on how to install and use this simulator is available in our [Gitlab wiki on Framagit](https://framagit.org/s4bxi/s4bxi/-/wikis/home)
